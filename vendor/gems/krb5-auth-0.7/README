Ruby bindings for the Kerberos library

This is an implementation of Ruby bindings for the Kerberos library.

To build a gem, you'll want to:

$ rake gem
$ sudo gem install pkg/krb5-auth-{VERSION}.gem

To build an RPM, you'll want to:

$ rake rpm
$ sudo rpm -Uvh pkg/{i386,x86_64}/rubygem-krb5-auth-{VERSION}.{i386,x86_64}.rpm

and then install the resulting RPM.

To build it just for development, you'll want to:
$ rake build

To build the documentation, make sure you have rdoc installed, and then:
$ rake rdoc
